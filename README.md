# Workout Motivational Tool

This is an android application aimed at getting you motivated to move from your couch. Right now!

The principle is :
- You enter the time you want to train for 
- You press the button
- That's it . . .

And then you will know at what time you'll be back home ! So you can plan the rest of the day

No more excuses such as : I don't have time, it takes too long, I have [thing] planned later I'm never gonna be done in time, etc ...

## Why ?
It's simple I found myself quite often in the situation where I want to train but think I might not actually have enough time to finish the session and be on time for the rest of my activities.
Like many of you I ended up wasting my time realizing I definitively had enough time ^_^

Now, no more problems I have my exact time at wich I will be done and I can plan accordingly, AWESOME !!

## How does it work ?
When you press the "Motivate Me" button, your smartphone geolocates you, calculates the time needed to reach your gym, using traffic data and then adds warmup and stretching time (+shower).

That's how it's able to tell so precisely the time you'll be back home.

The warmup & stretching times are customizable in the settings.
You can change your gym location (or select home) via a button on the main screen.

## Important information
To be able to test the project, you have to generate an API key for the Google Maps API.
There's plenty of tutorial on how to do that
