{"name":"MoovIn5","tagline":"","body":"# MoovIn5\r\n\r\nThis is an android application aimed at getting you motivated to move from your couch. Right now!\r\n\r\nThe principle is :\r\n- You enter the time you want to train for \r\n- You press the button\r\n- That's it . . .\r\n\r\nAnd then you will know at what time you'll be back home ! So you can plan the rest of the day\r\n\r\nNo more excuses such as : I don't have time, it takes too long, I have [thing] planned later I'm never gonna be done in time, etc ...\r\n\r\n## Why ?\r\nIt's simple I found myself quite often in the situation where I want to train but think I might not actually have enough time to finish the session and be on time for the rest of my activities.\r\nLike many of you I ended up wasting my time realizing I definitively had enough time ^_^\r\n\r\nNow, no more problems I have my exact time at wich I will be done and I can plan accordingly, AWESOME !!\r\n\r\n## How does it work ?\r\nWhen you press the \"Motivate Me\" button, your smartphone geolocates you, calculates the time needed to reach your gym, using traffic data and then adds warmup and stretching time (+shower).\r\n\r\nThat's how it's able to tell so precisely the time you'll be back home.\r\n\r\nThe warmup & stretching times are customizable in the settings.\r\nYou can change your gym location (or select home) via a button on the main screen.\r\n\r\n## Important information\r\nTo be able to test the project, you have to generate an API key for the Google Maps API.\r\nThere's plenty of tutorial on how to do that\r\n","google":"UA-61995895-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
